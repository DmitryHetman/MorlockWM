# MorlockWM

MorlockWM is a Wayland compositor written in Rust, and it is a hybrid between c00kiemon5ster's monsterwm and sulami's FrankenWM

##Motivation
As the mass production of HiDPI displays ensues, the more likely people will switch from the original ~96 dpi to a more "retina" esque screen. 
I am one of those people, and I am unhappy with the amount of tiling window managers for Wayland, I have decided to push ahead and create one.
